The specification of requirements is a critical activity in software and system development. A defect in a requirement specification can result in a situation where a software or system is delivered that fullfills the given requirements, but does not satisfy the customer's needs due to erroneous requirments. Requirement analysis, as a human activity, is error-prone. Especially for large sets of requirements, it is difficult and time consuming to manually check whether a given property is satisfied or not. Requirement based testing is helpful to increase the efficiency during development. Obtaining a high test coverage on requirements often takes a long time. As the number of requirements increases over the releases, the test specifications have to cover more and more requirements. Hanfor is developed to ease the process of requirement analysis. Its method consists of three major steps to discover requirement defects and obtain test specifications based on a set of informal requirements (Figure 1): Requirement Formalization Requirement Check Test Generation Figure 1: The Hanfor tool discovers requirement defects and derives test specifications from a given set of informal requirements. Requirement Formalization # To make it possible for a computer to check a set of requirements for a given criteria, it has to \"understand\" the semantics of the requirements. This could be achieved by using formal languages, which usually share the fact that they are rarely understandable for humans. In this method we make use of a simple pattern language. The language is based on a restricted English grammar and hence looks like natural language. Requirements formalized in this specification language can automatically be translated into logics. Specification language # The grammar of the specification language is given below. A requirement is defined by an ID, a scope and a pattern. Scope and pattern are parameterised by expressions over system observables and durations. Some patterns require a more detailed description concerning the order or the realtime occurence of events. REQ ::= ID: SCOPE, PATTERN . SCOPE ::= Globally | Before EXPR | After EXPR | Between EXPR and EXPR | After EXPR until EXPR PATTERN ::= It is never the case that EXPR holds | It is always the case that EXPR holds | It is always the case that if EXPR holds, then EXPR holds as well | Transition to states in which EXPR holds occur at most twice | It is always the case that ORDER | It is always the case that REALTIME ORDER ::= | If EXPR holds, then EXPR previously held | If EXPR holds and is succeded by EXPR, then EXPR previously held | If EXPR holds, then EXPR previously held and was preceeded by EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR eventually holds and is succeeded by EXPR | If EXPR holds and is succeeded by EXPR, then EXPR eventually holds after EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR eventually holds and is succeeded by EXPR where EXPR does not hold between EXPR and EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR toggles EXPR REALTIME ::= Once EXPR becomes satisfied, it holds for at least DURATION | Once EXPR becomes satisfied, it holds for less than DURATION | EXPR holds at least every DURATION | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds after at most DURATION | If EXPR holds for at least DURATION, then EXPR holds afterwards for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds for at least DURATION, then EXPR holds afterwards | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds after at most DURATION for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds, then there is at least one execution sequence such that EXPR holds after at most DURATION | After EXPR holds for DURATION, then EXPR holds | After EXPR holds for DURATION and EXPR holds, then EXPR holds | If EXPR holds, then EXPR toggles EXPR at most DURATION later Figure 2 shows the toolchain for the translation of an informal requirement into a formalized version. In the first step, the informal requirement, given in natural language, is translated into the specification language. This process is done manually. The requirement expressed in the specification language is then automatically translated into a formula in realtime logic (the Duration Calculus). Figure 2: A specification language for real-time requirements is used as an intermediate step in the translation from informal to formalized requirements. Requirement Check # The Hanfor tool chain checks requirements for the following three correctness properties: Consistency Realtime-consistency Vacuity Consistency # A set of requirements is inconsistent, if there exists no system satisfying all requirements in the set. Consider the two requirements in the specification language given below. This set of requirements is obviously not consistent as there is no interpretation where the observable 'A' evaluates both to true and to false at each point in time. Example 1: Inconsistent requirements Req1: Globally, it is never the case that 'A' holds. Req2: Globally, it is always the case that 'A' holds. Inconsistency in a set of requirements can be resolved by erasing or changing requirements. Realtime-consistency (rt-consistency) # A set of requirements is rt-inconsistent, if there are conflicts between requirements that arise after a certain time. Example 2: Rt-inconsistent requirements Req3: Globally, it is always the case that if 'B' holds then 'C' holds after at most '5' time units. Req4: Globally, it is always the case that if 'A' holds then '!C' holds for at least '2' time units. Consider the two real-time requirements given above. The set of the two requirements is consistent. Figure 3 gives an example of an interpretation of 'A', 'B', and 'C' (in form of a timing diagram) that satisfies both requirments. Figure 3: Consistency of the set of requirements {Req3, Req4}. 'A' and 'B' occur at the same point in time for one time unit, then '!C' for two time units satisfies Req4, and 'C' occurring at time 5 satisfies Req3. However, there are assignments for which the requirements are in conflict, as depicted in the example trace (Figure 4). If 'A' and 'B'change values as shown in the figure, than at time 5, Req4 would only be satisfied if 'C' remained false while Req3 would only be satisfied if 'C' changed to true . Figure 4: Witness for the rt-inconsistency of the set of requirements {Req3, Req4}. From time 4 on, the system steers toward inevitable rt-inconsistency. There are several possibilities to resolve the rt-inconsistency in a set of requirements, e.g. by erasing, changing or adding requirements. Example 2 (Cont.): Resolving rt-inconsistency Erasing requirements e.g. Erase Req4 Changing requirements e.g. Make Req4 less restrictive: Req4': Globally, it is always the case that if 'A' holds and 'B' did not hold in the last 5 time units, then '!C' holds for at least '2' time units. Adding requirements e.g. Add the following requirement: Req5: Globally, it is always the case that if 'B' holds, '!A' holds for at least 5 time units. Vacuity # A set of requirements is vacuous, if the behaviour specified by the requirements cannot be triggered in a system satisfying all requirements. More intuitively spoken, a vacuous requirement can be imagined as dead code in an implementation: Both a vacouous requirement as well as dead code can be removed without changing the meaning of the remaining part. Consider again the requirements Req1 and Req4 given below. The set of requirements is consistent. However, the precondition of Req4 is never true as this would violate Req1. Req4 is therefore vacuously satisfied in this set of requirements. Example 3: Vacuous requirements Req1: Globally, it is never the case that 'A' holds. Req4: Globally, it is always the case that if 'A' holds then '!C' holds for at least '2' time units. There are several possibilities to resolve vacuity in a set of requirements. Example 3 (cont.): Resolving vacuity Erasing requirements e.g. Erase Req1 Changing requirements e.g. Make Req1 less restrictive: Req2': Before \"Startup\", it is never the case that 'A'holds. Test Generation # Formalized requirements can be used to automatically generate test specifications. An automatic test generation helps to reduce the time needed to write test specifications with a high coverage rate. The efficiency during development can be increased and the maintainability costs can be reduced. Algorithm # Testing requires information about observability. The system variables are therefore categorized into input, output, and hidden (i.e. internal) variables. A sequence of inputs deterministically causes the valuation of the output variable. Figure 5 shows an abstract view of a two-input system with the variables A , B and C . Figure 5: System S with input variables A , B , and output variable C . The test generation algorithm automatically generates system tests that are based only on the formalized requirements (i.e. do not depend on an additional system model). It generates at least one test case per output variable, but as most as many test cases such that every requirement is tested. Each generated test indicates the requirements that it is based on. It is ensured that the generated tests may not lead to false positives (i.e. the test case fails, although the system state is conform with the requirements). In case that there exist untestable requirements, the algorithm lists the set of untestable requirements. Test Cases # The test cases generated by Hanfor contain three sorts of information: A sequence of n inputs: The initial state of the system, as well as the inputs for steps 1 to n . The expected outcome: The expected valuation of the tested output variable. The indication on which requirements the test is based on. Consider the set of requirements given below. The variables A , B are considered to be inputs of the system (Figure 5), H and I are hidden variables, and C represents the output of the system. Example 4: Requirements to be tested Req1: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018A\u2019 holds then \u2018H\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. Req2: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018B\u2019 holds then \u2018I\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. Req3: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018H AND I\u2019 holds then \u2018C\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. The test generation tool outputs the following test case: Case SystemTest: TestGeneratorResult: Found Test for: [C] Test Vector: Set inputs: A := true, B := true Wait for at most 20 for: C == true, (req3) The given test case tests the output variable C based on the third requirement. The input sequence is specified by an initial state only, in which both input variables A and B are set to true . The output variable C is expected to evaluate to true after at most 20 time units. Tool support # Hanfor takes as input an exported .csv file from Doors and stores the requirements. Figure 7 shows a screenshot of requirements imported into a Hanfor session. There are two IDs, the Hanfor ID and the Doors ID, so that the two databases can be synchronized. The informal requirements are listed in the column 'Description'. Once a requirement is formalized in the specification language, it is listed in the column 'Formalization'. Figure 6: Requirements exported into a Hanfor session. Clicking on a requirement opens the modification page of the requirement (Figure 8). The requirement can be formalized in the specification language by using the drop-down lists for both scopes and patterns. The variables can be specified manually by using the autocomplete function of the signal database. Figure 7: Modification window of a single requirement.

This set of requirements is obviously not consistent as there is no interpretation where the observable 'A' evaluates both to true and to false at each point in time. Example 1: Inconsistent requirements Req1: Globally, it is never the case that 'A' holds. Req2: Globally, it is always the case that 'A' holds.

Example 2: Rt-inconsistent requirements Req3: Globally, it is always the case that if 'B' holds then 'C' holds after at most '5' time units. Req4: Globally, it is always the case that if 'A' holds then '!C' holds for at least '2' time units. Consider the two real-time requirements given above. The set of the two requirements is consistent. Figure 3 gives an example of an interpretation of 'A', 'B', and 'C' (in form of a timing diagram) that satisfies both requirments. Figure 3: Consistency of the set of requirements {Req3, Req4}. 'A' and 'B' occur at the same point in time for one time unit, then '!C' for two time units satisfies Req4, and 'C' occurring at time 5 satisfies Req3. However, there are assignments for which the requirements are in conflict, as depicted in the example trace (Figure 4). If 'A' and 'B'change values as shown in the figure, than at time 5, Req4 would only be satisfied if 'C' remained false while Req3 would only be satisfied if 'C' changed to true . Figure 4: Witness for the rt-inconsistency of the set of requirements {Req3, Req4}. From time 4 on, the system steers toward inevitable rt-inconsistency. There are several possibilities to resolve the rt-inconsistency in a set of requirements, e.g. by erasing, changing or adding requirements. Example 2 (Cont.): Resolving rt-inconsistency Erasing requirements e.g. Erase Req4 Changing requirements e.g. Make Req4 less restrictive: Req4': Globally, it is always the case that if 'A' holds and 'B' did not hold in the last 5 time units, then '!C' holds for at least '2' time units.

More intuitively spoken, a vacuous requirement can be imagined as dead code in an implementation: Both a vacouous requirement as well as dead code can be removed without changing the meaning of the remaining part. Consider again the requirements Req1 and Req4 given below. The set of requirements is consistent. However, the precondition of Req4 is never true as this would violate Req1. Req4 is therefore vacuously satisfied in this set of requirements. Example 3: Vacuous requirements Req1: Globally, it is never the case that 'A' holds.

Assuming that you are familiar with the basic concept of Boolean logic, there are only three additional operators that need to be introduced.

event automaton (PEA) is a special automaton that allows to measure time. In Hanfor, PEAs are used to model the requirements that are already translated into DC-Counterexample Formulae . PEAs are used as an intermediate step between the formalized requirements and the requirements check respectively test generation procedure. In this documentation, we included the PEA representation of the available patterns as it often helps to get a more precise idea of what the exact meaning of a pattern is. Although a restricted english grammar is used to express requirements, it may happen that people have different interpretations of one and the same requirement. The PEA representation of a requirement however is unambiguous. This short guide should give you an intuitive understanding of how to interpret the phase event automata given in the pattern section of this documentation. If you are interested in a formal description of phase event automata, please refer to our paper \" Scalable Analysis of Real-Time Requirements \". Representation of PEAs # Figure 1 shows a phase event automaton representing the following requirement: req1: Globally, it is always the case that if \"R\" holds for at least \"5\" time units, then \"Q\" holds afterwards. Figure 1: Phase event automaton modeling requirement req1 . First we will have a look at the different components that are used to depict a PEA. Variables: The variables and time constants that occur in the PEA are directly coming from the corresponding requirement. req1 contains two boolean variables, namely \"R\" and \"Q\", and the timing constant \"5\". Each timing constant is related to a unique clock variable. The timing constant and its corresponding clock variable can be found in the PEA as a boolean time constraint, e.g. \"c0<5\". The boolean variables can occur as unprimed variables (e.g. Q) and primed variables (e.g. Q'). Unprimed variables are related to the current point in time whereas primed variables are related to a point in time in the future. Phases: The PEA consists of locations or phases, and edges representing transistions between the phases. Each phase of the PEA consists of a unique name, a phase invariant and a clock invariant. E.g. consider the PEA phase given in Figure 2. The name is \"st01W\", the phase invariant is given by the expression \"R\" and the clock invariant by the time constraint \"c0<=5\". If a phase has an incoming edge that has no source, we call it \"initial\". Figure 2: Exemplary phase of a PEA defined by its name, phase invariant, and clock invariant. Transitions: Each transition between phases is labeled with a boolean expression called \"guard\" and may additionally carry a clock reset statement. The guard may contain primed and unprimed variables as well as timing constraints. A transition from one phase to another can only be taken if the guarding expression is satisfied: This means that the guarding expression must evaluate to true under the current valuation (for unprimed variables and the clock constraint) together with the subsequent valuation (for the primed variables). If there is no constraint the guard is trivially satisfied and hence set to true . Run of a PEA # Next we want to be able to describe the behavior that is (not) included in a PEA. Other than most types of automata, a PEA has no explicit acceptance condition. A configuration of a PEA contains a location, a valuation of the variables and clocks, and a duration. A run of a PEA is a sequence of configurations such that the following conditions are satisfied: The location of the first configuration is initial. In each configuration, the valuation of variables fulfils the phase invariant of the corresponding location. In each configuration, the valuation of clocks and the clocks increased by the duration fulfils the clock invariant of the corresponding location. For every pair of consecutive configurations, there is an edge from the location of the predecessor configuration to the location of the consecutive configuration such that the guard is fulfilled. Example 1: Configurations of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". Below you find some configurations of the given PEA: (st0, {R= true , Q= false }, {c0=2}, 2) (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=4}, 6) (st01, {R= false , Q= true }, {c0=7}, 3) Example 2: Run of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". The following sequence of three configurations describes a run of the given PEA: (st0, {R= false , Q= false }, {c0=2}, 4); (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=4}, 1); (st01, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=7}, 3) Let us check whether the conditions for a run are satisfied for all configurations in the sequence: 1. Configuration: The location \"st0\" is initial as it has an incoming edge without source. The phase invariant \"!R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= false \". The clock invariant true can not be violated. There is an edge from location \"st0\" to the location \"st01W\" of the second configuration. The guard is true and can not be violated. 2. Configuration: The phase invariant \"R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= true \". The clock invariant \"c0<=5\" is fulfilled by the clock valuation \"c0=4\" and also holds for the entire duration of \"1\". There is an edge from location \"st01W\" to the location \"st01\" of the third configuration with the guarding expression \"c0>=5\". The guard is fulfilled by the clock valuation increased by the duration. 3. Configuration: The phase invariant \"Q && R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= true , Q= true \". The clock invariant is \" true \" and hence trivially satisfied. Example 3: Not-included Run of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". The following sequence of two configurations is not included in the given PEA: (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=2}, 3); (st01, {R= true , Q= false }, {c0=7}, 32) Let us check whether the conditions for a run are satisfied for all configurations in the sequence: 1. Configuration: The location \"st01W\" is initial as it has an incoming edge without source. The phase invariant \"R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= true \". The clock invariant \"c0<=5\" is fulfilled by the clock valuation \"c0=2\" and also holds for the entire duration of \"3\". There is an edge from location \"st01W\" to the location \"st01\" of the second configuration with the guarding expression \"c0>=5\". The guard is fulfilled by the clock valuation increased by the duration. 2. Configuration: The phase invariant \"Q && R\" is violated by the valuation \"Q= false \". The clock invariant is \" true \" and hence trivially satisfied. As the phase invariant conditio is violated in the second configuration, the given sequence is not included in the given PEA. Timing Diagram # As the tupel representation of a run is not necessarily intuitive, we often depict a run in form of a timing diagram.

In Hanfor, PEAs are used to model the requirements that are already translated into DC-Counterexample Formulae . PEAs are used as an intermediate step between the formalized requirements and the requirements check respectively test generation procedure. In this documentation, we included the PEA representation of the available patterns as it often helps to get a more precise idea of what the exact meaning of a pattern is. Although a restricted english grammar is used to express requirements, it may happen that people have different interpretations of one and the same requirement. The PEA representation of a requirement however is unambiguous. This short guide should give you an intuitive understanding of how to interpret the phase event automata given in the pattern section of this documentation. If you are interested in a formal description of phase event automata, please refer to our paper \" Scalable Analysis of Real-Time Requirements \".","title":"Phase Event Automata"},{"location":"references/pea.html#representation-of-peas","text":"Figure 1 shows a phase event automaton representing the following requirement: req1: Globally, it is always the case that if \"R\" holds for at least \"5\" time units, then \"Q\" holds afterwards. Figure 1: Phase event automaton modeling requirement req1 . First we will have a look at the different components that are used to depict a PEA. Variables: The variables and time constants that occur in the PEA are directly coming from the corresponding requirement. req1 contains two boolean variables, namely \"R\" and \"Q\", and the timing constant \"5\". Each timing constant is related to a unique clock variable. The timing constant and its corresponding clock variable can be found in the PEA as a boolean time constraint, e.g. \"c0<5\". The boolean variables can occur as unprimed variables (e.g. Q) and primed variables (e.g. Q'). Unprimed variables are related to the current point in time whereas primed variables are related to a point in time in the future. Phases: The PEA consists of locations or phases, and edges representing transistions between the phases. Each phase of the PEA consists of a unique name, a phase invariant and a clock invariant. E.g. consider the PEA phase given in Figure 2. The name is \"st01W\", the phase invariant is given by the expression \"R\" and the clock invariant by the time constraint \"c0<=5\". If a phase has an incoming edge that has no source, we call it \"initial\". Figure 2: Exemplary phase of a PEA defined by its name, phase invariant, and clock invariant. Transitions: Each transition between phases is labeled with a boolean expression called \"guard\" and may additionally carry a clock reset statement. The guard may contain primed and unprimed variables as well as timing constraints. A transition from one phase to another can only be taken if the guarding expression is satisfied: This means that the guarding expression must evaluate to true under the current valuation (for unprimed variables and the clock constraint) together with the subsequent valuation (for the primed variables). If there is no constraint the guard is trivially satisfied and hence set to true .","title":"Representation of PEAs"},{"location":"references/pea.html#run-of-a-pea","text":"Next we want to be able to describe the behavior that is (not) included in a PEA. Other than most types of automata, a PEA has no explicit acceptance condition. A configuration of a PEA contains a location, a valuation of the variables and clocks, and a duration. A run of a PEA is a sequence of configurations such that the following conditions are satisfied: The location of the first configuration is initial. In each configuration, the valuation of variables fulfils the phase invariant of the corresponding location. In each configuration, the valuation of clocks and the clocks increased by the duration fulfils the clock invariant of the corresponding location. For every pair of consecutive configurations, there is an edge from the location of the predecessor configuration to the location of the consecutive configuration such that the guard is fulfilled. Example 1: Configurations of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". Below you find some configurations of the given PEA: (st0, {R= true , Q= false }, {c0=2}, 2) (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=4}, 6) (st01, {R= false , Q= true }, {c0=7}, 3) Example 2: Run of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". The following sequence of three configurations describes a run of the given PEA: (st0, {R= false , Q= false }, {c0=2}, 4); (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=4}, 1); (st01, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=7}, 3) Let us check whether the conditions for a run are satisfied for all configurations in the sequence: 1. Configuration: The location \"st0\" is initial as it has an incoming edge without source. The phase invariant \"!R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= false \". The clock invariant true can not be violated. There is an edge from location \"st0\" to the location \"st01W\" of the second configuration. The guard is true and can not be violated. 2. Configuration: The phase invariant \"R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= true \". The clock invariant \"c0<=5\" is fulfilled by the clock valuation \"c0=4\" and also holds for the entire duration of \"1\". There is an edge from location \"st01W\" to the location \"st01\" of the third configuration with the guarding expression \"c0>=5\". The guard is fulfilled by the clock valuation increased by the duration. 3. Configuration: The phase invariant \"Q && R\" is fulfilled by the valuation \"R= true , Q= true \". The clock invariant is \" true \" and hence trivially satisfied. Example 3: Not-included Run of a PEA Consider the PEA for req1 (Figure 1). It contains the variables \"R, Q\", the clock variable \"c0\", and the locations \"st0, st01W, st01\". The following sequence of two configurations is not included in the given PEA: (st01W, {R= true , Q= true }, {c0=2}, 3); (st01, {R= true , Q= false }, {c0=7}, 32) Let us check whether the conditions for a run are satisfied for all configurations in the sequence: 1.

It might be the case that you want to change this for a certain set of rows to another status. In this example we want to set every row of type meta to the status Done . To accomplish this we use the Search Query Language . In Hanfor, search :COL_INDEX_04:meta . This will search for rows which match \"meta\" in the 4. coloumn (Type). You should now only see the rows of type meta . Select all rows by clicking All . Click Edit selected and select Done in the field Set status . Finally, click Apply changes to selected requirements Formalization # Order your requirement overview by Pos , by clicking on the table column. REQ1 # To formalize this requirement, we click on the ID REQ1 to open then formalization-modal: Formalization modal Click on + to add a new formalization and then on ..(click to open) We now have to select a Scope and a Pattern . The scope is Globally , because the requirement states that \"var1 is always greater than 5\". The pattern is it is always the case that {R} holds . For {R} we insert the condition: var1 > 5 Set the status to Review and then press save changes . If you save a requirement, Hanfor will automatically create the used variables and derive their type. You can examine and even alter them in the section Variables , for the case that Hanfor did not derive a variable-type correctly. Definition of Scope and Pattern The same procedure can be applied to REQ2 - REQ6 REQ7 and REQ8 # REQ7 and REQ8 are different. Consider REQ7: if var3 = True then var4 := 0 . The scope is still Globally The pattern is it is always the case that if \"{R}\" holds, then \"{S}\" holds after at most \"{T}\" time units , because in a realtime-system a variable assignment does not happen instantly, there can be delays. For {R} we insert var3 , because the variable type is boolean. For {S} insert var4 == 0 , For {T} we need a certain amount of time units, for example 50. We do not want to hardcode values, we introduce a new variable and insert MAX_TIME . We end up with the following: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 0\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME\" time units. Save the formalization. You will now recognize that Hanfor automatically added a new Tag Type_inference_error to your freshly formalized requirement. To fix that, to go the Variables section and open the MAX_TIME variable. You see that Hanfor derived the type bool , but we actually want it to be of type CONST as the variable represents time units. Change the type and also assign a value, for example 50 . Example for the MAX_TIME variable For REQ8 you should have: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 1\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME\" time units. Exporting the formalized requirements. # Once you are done with all requirements, it is time to analyze them using a tool like Ultimate (TODO:ref to git). Preparing the export. # You might want to filter out some rows, for example, all of type meta or all that have a certain tag. Again, use the Search Query Language to select only the requirements you want. For example, if we only rows of type requirement which are not on status Todo we search: :COL_INDEX_04:requirement:AND::COL_INDEX_06::NOT:Todo Export # To export requirements, press Tools , then choose either .req or .csv . If you want to analyze the requirements using Ultimate, choose Generate .req file from (filtered) requirements table and then save it. You should end up with the following: CONST MAX_TIME IS 50.0 Input constraint1 IS bool Input constraint2 IS bool Input var1 IS int Input var2 IS int Input var3 IS bool Input var4 IS int REQ1_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"var1 > 5\" holds REQ2_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"var2 < 10\" holds REQ3_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint1\" holds REQ4_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint2\" holds REQ5_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"var1 < 5\" holds REQ6_0: Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint1 && constraint2 \" holds REQ7_0: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 1\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME\" time units REQ8_0: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 0\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME \" time units Analysis using Ultimate. # Get ReqAnalyzer # First of all you need the Ultimate tool ReqAnalyzer . See how in the ReqAnalyzer section. Perform the complete analysis. # We wrote a script, which perform a complete analysis, including the extraction of relevant information. The script is located in UReqCheck-linux . You have to configure run_complete_analysis.sh , which is used to run the complete analysis. The script takes several arguments: run_complete_analysis.sh <req_file> <req_repo_folder> <req_folder> [<rt_inconsistency_range> <timeout_per_assertion>] Where: req_file is the Requirements file you generated using Hanfor. req_repo_folder is the path to the repository, which contains the requirements-folder req_folder is the path to the requirements-folder rt_inconsistency_range (default: 2) is the amount of requirements which are checked together for RT-inconsistency. Careful with this parameter, it will blow up the amount of checks really fast. * timeout_per_assertion (default: 900) The time how long a singles assertion is checked. Use Ultimate # Execute the run_complete_analysis.sh script. $ cd /path/to/UReqCheck-linux $ ./run_complete_analysis.sh path/to/repo/example_input/example_input.req path/to/repo/example_input path/to/repo/example_input This will start Ultimate and run an analysis. The analysis checks for rt-inconsistency and vacuity and logs are be generated: hanfor/example/example_input.req.log hanfor/example/example_input.req.testgen.log hanfor/example/logs/example_input/example_input.req.relevant.log hanfor/example/logs/example_input/example_input.req.testgen.log Evaluate # In hanfor/example/example_input.req.log we can see that Ultimate reports: --- Results --- * Results from de.uni_freiburg.informatik.ultimate.pea2boogie: - RequirementInconsistentErrorResult: Requirements set is inconsistent. Requirements set is inconsistent. Some invariants are already infeasible. Responsible requirements: REQ6_0, REQ3_0, REQ4_0 Now, if we investigate REQ3, REQ4 and REQ6: REQ3_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint1\" holds REQ4_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint2\" holds REQ6_0: Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint1 && constraint2 \" holds We directly see what the problem is: On one hand, our invariants demand that constraint1 and constraint2 always holds, but on the other hand there is another invariant which demands that constraint1 and constraint2 never hold at the same time. Think about this as: constraint1 && constraint2 && ((constraint1 && !constraint2) || (!constraint1 && constraint2)) this is clearly unsatisfiable. Alter your requirements # We found an inconsistency in our requirements, that has to be fixed. Let's assume you review your requirements and you recognize REQ4 was defined wrong in the csv, where REQ4,constraint2 always holds,requirement should be REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement . While reading over the requirements, you also recognize that REQ1 and REQ5 collide and you find out that REQ5 shall be deleted. When we apply this changes, we end up with the following changes: Alter REQ4,constraint2 always holds,requirement to REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement Remove REQ5 and our csv file now looks as follows: ID,Description,Type META1,This is an example for some requirements,meta META2,Next we define some requirements,meta REQ1,var1 is always greater than 5,requirement REQ2,var2 is always smaller than 10,requirement REQ3,constraint1 always holds,requirement REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement REQ6,constraint1 and constraint2 never hold at the same time,requirement REQ7,if var3 = True then var4 = 0,requirement REQ8,if var3 = True then var4 = 1,requirement Time for a new revision. # We altered our requirements, we now need to create a new revision in Hanfor and change our formalizations. Execute: $ cd hanfor $ python3 app.py -r -c example/example_input.csv example_tag Hanfor will then ask: \"Which revision should I use as a base?\" , we choose revision_0 (as it is the only one, usually you want your latest revision). Then, Hanfor asks Should I use the csv header mapping from base revision? , as we did not change the csv header, we just keep the current one. A quick recap what happens when creating a revision: New requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_new_requirement Changed requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_data_changed and revision_0_to_revision_1_description_changed * Requirements where the formalization migrated to the new revision get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_migrated_formalized We now have to alter the requirements which have changed, that's only REQ4 . Open the formalization of REQ4 and correct it to Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint2\" holds . Ultimate Analysis #2 # Export your requirements as before with the name example_input_revision1.req Run Ultimate on the new requirements file. You can now examine the log created in hanfor/example/logs/example_input/example_input.req.relevant.log , which contains the following: - ReqCheckFailResult [Line: -1]: Requirements REQ8_0, REQ7_0 are rt-inconsistent A ReqCheckFailResult usually implies that something is broken, Ultimate found that requirements REQ7 and REQ8 are rt-inconsistent, let's analyze this result: REQ7,if var3 = True then var4 = 0,requirement REQ8,if var3 = True then var4 = 1,requirement These two requirements collide, because they assign different values to var4 when var3 holds. This is especially bad in a realtime system, because it can happen that var4 == 0 holds after a certain amount of time, and var4 == 1 holds at a later point of time or vice versa. Why is this bad? - because it can cause unexpected behaviour when a change propagates through the system.
