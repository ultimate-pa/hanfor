If you have many requirements it gets difficult to check that all of them are, e.g., consistent. No human can manually check >1000 requirements for consistency -- so we do our best with reviews. Also in new projects, what we often see, is that it takes a long time before there is a high test coverage on the requirements -- as the number of requirements increases over the releases, and thus also the test specifications have to cover more and more requirements. However, many defects are found by experience-based testing -- but these technique is often used quite late, as the first priority is to get a reasonable requirement-based coverage. To tackle that problem, Hanfor provides a method that consists of 3 steps: The Requirements Formalization The Requirements Check (on the formalized requirements) The Test Generation (on the formalized requirements) Example Picture 1 To make it possible for a computer to check a set of requirements for quality criteria, as e.g. consistency, it has to \"understand\" the semantics of the requirements. This could be achieved by using formal languages to express the requirements. However, they are rarely understandable for humans, so we would get requirements that the computer understands - but nearly no stakeholder. In this method we use a simple pattern language. The requirements expressed in the pattern language look like English sentences. Everything you can express in this patterns is then translated in the background into logical formulas. You could also easily translate them into German, Chinese, or other languages. Grammar of the specification language # The grammar is the following: REQ ::= ID: SCOPE, PATTERN . SCOPE ::= Globally | Before EXPR | After EXPR | Between EXPR and EXPR | After EXPR until EXPR PATTERN ::= It is never the case that EXPR holds | It is always the case that EXPR holds | It is always the case that if EXPR holds, then EXPR holds as well | Transition to states in which EXPR holds occur at most twice | It is always the case that ORDER | It is always the case that REALTIME ORDER ::= | If EXPR holds, then EXPR previously held | If EXPR holds and is succeded by EXPR, then EXPR previously held | If EXPR holds, then EXPR previously held and was preceeded by EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR eventually holds and is succeeded by EXPR | If EXPR holds and is succeeded by EXPR, then EXPR eventually holds after EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR eventually holds and is succeeded by EXPR where EXPR does not hold between EXPR and EXPR | If EXPR holds, then EXPR toggles EXPR REALTIME ::= Once EXPR becomes satisfied, it holds for at least DURATION | Once EXPR becomes satisfied, it holds for less than DURATION | EXPR holds at least every DURATION | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds after at most DURATION | If EXPR holds for at least DURATION, then EXPR holds afterwards for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds for at least DURATION, then EXPR holds afterwards | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds after at most DURATION for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds, then EXPR holds for at least DURATION | If EXPR holds, then there is at least one execution sequence such that EXPR holds after at most DURATION | After EXPR holds for DURATION, then EXPR holds | If EXPR holds, then EXPR toggles EXPR at most DURATION later EXPR is an expression (e.g. vehicleSpeed<10 && Terminal15==ON ). Thus, in a first step the informal requirements are translated into requirements in the specification language shown above. This is done manually. In the background the tool translates the requirements in specification language then into logical formulas. Example Picture 2 Tool support # The tool to assist this step is called Hanfor.It looks a little bit like Doors. It takes as input a csv-Export from Doors, and then stores the requirements. There are two IDs, the Hanfor ID and the Doors ID, so that you can synchronize the two databases, and can easily identify changes. Example Picture 3 Clicking on a requirements you can then specify the requirement in the specification language as visible in the next screenshot. The tool provides both patterns and also a signal database, so that you have a auto-complete function when filling out the variables. Example Picture 4 Example Picture 5 The tool checks for the following correctness criteria: Consistency Vacuity rt-Consistency Example Req1: It is always the case that \"IRTest\" holds. Req2: It is never the case that \"IRTest\" holds. Inconsistency can be resolved by erasing requirements changing requirements Example Req1: It is always the case that if \"Signal-A\" holds then \"Signal-B\" holds after at most 10 ms. Req2: It is never the case that \"Signal-A\" holds. These requirements are consistent, but the precondition of Req1 is never true, i.e., Req1 is vacuously satisfied in this set of requirements. Vacuity can be resolved by erasing requirements, or changing requirements Example Erase Req2 or make it less restrictive Change Req2 to Req2': Before \"Startup\", it is never the case that \"Signal-A\" holds. Realtime-consistency (rt-consistency) # A set of requirements is rt-inconsistent, if there are conflicts between requirements that arise after a certain time. Example Req1: It is always the case that if \u201eIRTest\u201c holds, then \u201eIRLampsOn\u201c holds after at most 10 seconds Req2: It is always the case that if \u201eIRTest\u201c holds, then \u201eNOT(IRLampsOn)\u201c holds for at least 6 seconds. is consistent, but there are assignments with a conflict as shown in the following example. Example Picture 6 As IRTest gets valid in timepoint t=4, req1 requires, that in the time interval t=[4...14] IRLampsOn gets true as well. As IRTest is still valid in timepoint t=10, req2 requires, that IRLampsOn stays \"false\" until at least t=16. Thus, in t=14 we have a conflict - however the system reacts, one requirement will be violated. Resolve rt-inconsistency by erasing requirements, or changing requirements, or adding requirements Erase Req2, or make it less restrictive \u2013Req2\u2018: It is always the case that if IRTest holds and it did not hold in the last 10 s, then NOT(IRLampsOn) holds for at least 6 s. Or add Req3: Once IRTest appears, it holds for at most 3 seconds. Req4: Once IRTest disappears, it is absent for at least 10 seconds System test case generation # When having the requirements formalized in the specification language, it makes sense to also automatically generate test specifications out of them. There are several reasons to do so: Example Picture 7 Thus the algorithm has to: Automatically generate system tests only using requirements Generate small set of tests (test suite) Generate one test case per output variable Generate so many tests that every requirement is tested Generate tests that may not lead to false positives Ensure traceability to the requirements (i.e. indicate what requirements are tested by the test) The generated Test (case) consists of Sequence of inputs (Initial state of system, Inputs for steps 1...n) Expected outcome (oracle for step n) Link to the tested requirement Generate a feedback if there are untestable requirements Output: Set of untestable requirements (No seq. of Inputs deterministically causes the output) Example Picture 8 Requirements to be tested req1: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018A\u2019 holds then \u2018H\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. req2: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018B\u2019 holds then \u2018I\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. req3: Globally, it is always the case that if \u2018H AND I\u2019 holds then \u2018O\u2019 holds after at most \u201810\u2019 time units. Testing requires information about observability. Thus, we need to categorize the variables into Input, Output, and Hidden (i.e. internal variables): Inputs: A, B Outputs: O Hidden: H, I In the Test Generator Tool you can choose the following options: generate System Test (i.e. the tests only speak about system inputs and outputs, but no internal variables) generate System Integration Test (i.e., the tests speak about system input, system outputs and internal variables) output of the test generation tool Case SystemTest: TestGeneratorResult: Found Test for: [O] Test Vector: Set inputs: A := true, B := true Wait for at most 20 for: O == true, (req3) Case System Integration Test: ------| Test: req3 |----------------------- TestGeneratorResult: Found Test for: [O] Test Vector: Set inputs: A := true, B := true Wait for at most 10 for: H == true (req1) Wait for at most 10 for: I == true (req2) Wait for at most 20 for: O == true, (req3)","title":"What is Hanfor?"},{"location":"#what-is-hanfor","text":"Hanfor h elps an alyzing an d for malizing r equirements.

It might be the case that you want to change this for a certain set of rows to another status. In this example we want to set every row of type meta to the status Done . To accomplish this we use the Search Query Language . In Hanfor, search :COL_INDEX_04:meta . This will search for rows which match \"meta\" in the 4. coloumn (Type). You should now only see the rows of type meta . Select all rows by clicking All . Click Edit selected and select Done in the field Set status . Finally, click Apply changes to selected requirements Formalization # Order your requirement overview by Pos by clicking on the table column. REQ1 # To formalize this requirement, we click on the ID REQ1 to open then formalization-modal: Formalization modal Click on + to add a new formalization and then on ..(click to open) We now have to select a Scope and a Pattern . - The scope is Globally , because the requirement states that \"var1 is always greater than 5\". - The pattern is it is always the case that {R} holds . - For {R} we insert the condition: var1 > 5 - Set the status to Review and then press save changes . If you save a requirement, Hanfor will automatically create the used variables and derive their type. You can examine and even alter them in the section Variables , for the case that Hanfor did not derive a variable-type correctly. Definition of Scope and Pattern The same procedure can be applied to REQ2 - REQ6 REQ7 and REQ8 # REQ7 and REQ8 are different. Consider REQ7: if var3 = True then var4 := 1 . The scope is still Globally The pattern is it is always the case that if \"{R}\" holds, then \"{S}\" holds after at most \"{T}\" time units , because in a realtime-system a variable assignment does not happen instantly, there can be delays. For {R} we insert var3 , because the variable type is boolean. For {S} insert var3 == 1 , For {T} we need a certain amount of time units, for example 50. We do not want to hardcode values, we introduce a new variable and insert MAX_TIME . We end up with the following: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 1\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME\" time units. Save the formalization. You will now recognize that Hanfor automatically added a new Tag Type_inference_error to your freshly formalized requirement. To fix that, to go the Variables section and open the MAX_TIME variable. You see that Hanfor derived the type bool , but we actually want it to be of type CONST as the variable represents time units. Change the type and also assign a value, for example 50 . Example for the MAX_TIME variable For REQ8 you should have: Globally, it is always the case that if \"var3\" holds, then \"var4 == 0\" holds after at most \"MAX_TIME\" time units. Exporting the formalized requirements. # Once you are done with all requirements, it is time to analyze them using a tool like Ultimate (TODO:ref to git). Preparing the export. # You might want to filter out some rows, for example, all of type meta or all that have a certain tag. Again, use the Search Query Language to select only the requirements you want. For example, if we only rows of type requirement which are not on status Todo we search: :COL_INDEX_04:requirement:AND::COL_INDEX_06::NOT:Todo Export # To export requirements, press Tools , then choose either .req or .csv . If you want to analyze the requirements using Ultimate, choose Generate .req file from (filtered) requirements table and then save it.

Requirements set is inconsistent. Some invariants are already infeasible. Responsible requirements: REQ6_0, REQ3_0, REQ4_0 Now, if we investigate REQ3, REQ4 and REQ6: REQ3_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint1\" holds REQ4_0: Globally, it is always the case that \"constraint2\" holds REQ6_0: Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint1 && constraint2 \" holds We directly see what the problem is: On one hand, our invariants demand that constraint1 and constraint2 always holds, but on the other hand there is another invariant which demands that constraint1 and constraint2 never hold at the same time. Think about this as: constraint1 && constraint2 && ((constraint1 && !constraint2) || (!constraint1 && constraint2)) this is clearly unsatisfiable. Alter your requirements # We now found an inconsistency in our requirements, that has to be fixed. Let's assume you review your requirements and you recognize REQ4 was defined wrong in the csv, where REQ4,constraint2 always holds,requirement should be REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement . While reading over the requirements, you also recognize that REQ1 and REQ5 collide and you find out that REQ5 shall be deleted. When we apply this changes, we end up with the following changes: alter REQ4,constraint2 always holds,requirement to REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement remove REQ5 and our csv file now looks as follows: ID,Description,Type META1,This is an example for some requirements,meta META2,Next we define some requirements,meta REQ1,var1 is always greater than 5,requirement REQ2,var2 is always smaller than 10,requirement REQ3,constraint1 always holds,requirement REQ4,constraint2 never holds,requirement REQ6,constraint1 and constraint2 never hold at the same time,requirement REQ7,if var3 = True then var4 = 0,requirement REQ8,if var3 = True then var4 = 1,requirement Time for a new revision. # We altered our requirements, we now need to create a new revision in Hanfor and change our formalizations. Execute: $ cd hanfor $ python3 app.py -r -c example/example_input.csv example_tag Hanfor will then ask: \"Which revision should I use as a base?\" , we choose revision_0 (as it is the only one, usually you want your latest revision). Then, Hanfor asks Should I use the csv header mapping from base revision? , as we did not change the csv header, we just keep the current one. A quick recap what happens when creating a revision: - New requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_new_requirement - Changed requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_data_changed and revision_0_to_revision_1_description_changed - Requirements where the formalization migrated to the new revision get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_migrated_formalized We now have to alter the requirements which have changed, that's only REQ4 . Open the formalization of REQ4 and correct it to Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint2\" holds . Ultimate Analysis #2 # Export your requirements as before with the name example_input_revision1.req Run Ultimate on the new requirements file. You can now examine the log created in hanfor/example/logs/example_input/example_input.req.relevant.log , which contains the following: - ReqCheckFailResult [Line: -1]: Requirements REQ8_0, REQ7_0 are rt-inconsistent A ReqCheckFailResult usually implies that something is broken, Ultimate found that requirements REQ7 and REQ8 are rt-inconsistent, let's analyze this result: REQ7,if var3 = True then var4 = 0,requirement REQ8,if var3 = True then var4 = 1,requirement These two requirements collide, because they assign different values to var4 when var3 holds. This is especially bad in a realtime system, because it can happen that var4 == 0 holds after a certain amount of time, and var4 == 1 holds at a later point of time or vice versa. Why is this bad? - because it can cause unexpected behaviour when a change propagates through the system.

A quick recap what happens when creating a revision: - New requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_new_requirement - Changed requirements get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_data_changed and revision_0_to_revision_1_description_changed - Requirements where the formalization migrated to the new revision get the tag revision_0_to_revision_1_migrated_formalized We now have to alter the requirements which have changed, that's only REQ4 . Open the formalization of REQ4 and correct it to Globally, it is never the case that \"constraint2\" holds .","title":"Time for a new revision."},{"location":"usage/workflow/#ultimate-analysis-2","text":"Export your requirements as before with the name example_input_revision1.req Run Ultimate on the new requirements file. You can now examine the log created in hanfor/example/logs/example_input/example_input.req.relevant.log , which contains the following: - ReqCheckFailResult [Line: -1]: Requirements REQ8_0, REQ7_0 are rt-inconsistent A ReqCheckFailResult usually implies that something is broken, Ultimate found that requirements REQ7 and REQ8 are rt-inconsistent, let's analyze this result: REQ7,if var3 = True then var4 = 0,requirement REQ8,if var3 = True then var4 = 1,requirement These two requirements collide, because they assign different values to var4 when var3 holds. This is especially bad in a realtime system, because it can happen that var4 == 0 holds after a certain amount of time, and var4 == 1 holds at a later point of time or vice versa. Why is this bad? - because it can cause unexpected behaviour when a change propagates through the system.","title":"Ultimate Analysis #2"},{"location":"usage/workflow/#conclusion","text":"You are now able to: Setup hanfor, Formalize requirements, Filter requirements, Export them to a .req file Run Ultimate on a .req file Interpret the results of Ultimate Create new revisions in hanfor to fix mistakes in requirements.","title":"Conclusion"}]}
