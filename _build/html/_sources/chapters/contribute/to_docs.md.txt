# Documentation
In this section we explain how you can contribute to the documentation.

## Structure of the Documentation
Hanfors documentation section is located in the directory `documentation/docs` and looks as follows:
```
|-docs
 |- chapters/  # The chapters directory contains the different sections of our documentation.
 |- img/       # In this directory we store images.
 |- conf.py    # The sphinx configuration file.
 |- index.rst  # The index file, it defines the outline of the documentation.
```

### Chapters
- Every chapter is a directory in `documentation/docs/chapters`.
- If you want to **add a new chapter**, you must **create a new directory** and also add it to `index.rst`
- Inside a chapter-directory you create `.md` or `.rst` files.
## Contribute

Head over to [Hanfor's Git repository](https://github.com/ultimate-pa/hanfor) and fork it, 
create to edit existing chapters and when you are done, simply PR.


## Sphinx and Sphinx Autobuild

This documentation is made with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
```
python3 -m pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild recommonmark sphinx_rtd_theme dhubbard-sphinx-markdown-tables
```
You can now use ``make html`` or ``./make.bat html`` to build your documentation. 

You can also live preview your changes in the browser.
We just use [autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/) to automagically build the docs and show them in a web-browser.
To build a classical Sphinx documentation set, issue the following command in the directory  `documentation`:
```
sphinx-autobuild -E docs docs/_build/html
```
This will create a directory  `_build` which contains generated HTML files.
Then head to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and witness the most beautiful documentation ever created.
